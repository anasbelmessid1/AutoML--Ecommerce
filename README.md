## Project 1: A/B Testing with Machine Learning

### Overview
A/B testing is a fundamental approach in e-commerce for optimizing marketing strategies and understanding customer preferences. This project leverages machine learning to enhance the traditional A/B testing process by predicting customer behavior and improving the accuracy of the test results.

### Code Explanation
The notebook `A B tests with Machine Learning.ipynb` includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset containing the results of A/B tests.
   - Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the data to understand the distribution of variables and the relationships between them.
   - Generate insights from the data that can inform the machine learning model.
3. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Select appropriate machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) for the prediction task.
   - Train the models using the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compare the results to select the best model.
5. **Prediction and Analysis**:
   - Use the trained model to predict customer behavior in the A/B test.
   - Analyze the predictions to make informed decisions about marketing strategies.

### Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `A B tests with Machine Learning.ipynb`.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the models, and analyze the results.

## Project 2: Multi-label Classification for E-commerce

### Overview
In e-commerce, products often belong to multiple categories. Multi-label classification is essential for accurately categorizing products and improving the user experience. This project uses AutoML to automate the training process and enhance the accuracy of the multi-label classification model.

### Code Explanation
The notebook `multi_label_trainer.ipynb` includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset containing product descriptions and their associated categories.
   - Preprocess the data by cleaning text, encoding labels, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform EDA to understand the distribution of product categories and the characteristics of the text data.
3. **AutoML Configuration and Training**:
   - Configure the AutoML settings to specify the search space, evaluation metric, and other parameters.
   - Use AutoML to train multiple models and select the best-performing one.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for multi-label classification.
   - Analyze the results to ensure the model meets the desired performance criteria.
5. **Prediction and Analysis**:
   - Use the trained model to predict the categories of new products.
   - Analyze the predictions to validate the model's effectiveness.

### Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `multi_label_trainer.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions and execute the cells to preprocess the data, configure AutoML, train the models, and evaluate the results.
